        description: 'Full-Stack game that uses React and P5.js on the frontend, and uses Socket.io and the Maze API on the backend. Users must start a game with their name, which then creates a lobby with a unique id using Socket.io, they then can send that id to up to 7 other users. Players then race to the center of a randomly generated maze generated by the Maze API and rendered via P5.js, when one player wins, it then sends a winning/losing message to all other players. My duties were to create most of the React components and work on the design of the app.',
